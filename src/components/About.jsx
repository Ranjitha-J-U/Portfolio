      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 2025 Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate with
        hands-on experience in building backend-centric and full-stack
        applications using Java, Spring Boot, and React.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on designing RESTful APIs, implementing authentication
        and authorization, integrating databases, and connecting backend
        services with clean frontend interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am comfortable working across the full stack, with a strong
        inclination toward backend development, and open to frontend or
        full-stack roles based on project needs.
